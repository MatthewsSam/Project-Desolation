# Projet Desolation

The objective of this project is to create a basic horror game with Godot to showcase the possibilities of the 3D engine.

Due to the limited amount of ressources it would be better to keep everything simple

1. single environment
2. dumb ai (line of sight)
3. limited weapons but all projectiles
4. only a few zombie models
5. simple gui/hud
6. All textures/models would be preferably avaliable at the highest resolution possible (for an eventual future Godot 3.0 demo)
7. Levels in a closed environement
8. After some discusion, it will be probably in a steampunk lab/greenhouse
